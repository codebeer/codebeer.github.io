## Gaming on the Couch 

If you're thinking of moving you're PC into the lounge room, my build experince could offer some hints. 

+ Be **very careful** which TV you buy, unless you like Screen Tearing, I did a lot of research.  
+ Be consciouse of your Form Factor, you will never beat factory builds.  
+ The magic is ruined if the rig isn't silent - so splash out on the case etc.  
+ This build was MILLIMETER PERFECT. If I didn't get this exact PSU, it WOULD NOT FIT against the graphics card.   
+ I was really happy with the final product.  


## An Irrelevant Foreword on Agile Development

Valve are known for keeping their cards close to their chest with a "It'l be ready when It's ready" attitude which I (as a developer) secretly admire. 

For things like Half Life 3, I'm happy waiting, depsite the flux of hype and rumour. 

When Valve made the decission to open the conversation about their transition into the living room with the Steam Universe community - I thought it was a great move. Get the end user involved in a high risk venture early- and they did, going as far as to send out real beta hardware to user's homes.

As a developer working exclusively in agile environments, I'm all for customer input and frequent small iterations. I believe Valve were instrumental in this area when it came to customer marketplace interfaces - especially with the launch of Steam Greenlight - where potential customers vote on which indie games in their alpha stages should be completed and published to the store. 

If you're interested in this sort of discussion, I reccomended you listen to this early podcast from @Outware (are Apps a product or Service?) starring the very bright Lucia, who had recently completed a thesis surrounding the themes of the marketing process in agile software development.  

## In Retrospect

Anyway, I decided to build a SteamBox myself in Janurary of 2014 and not risk waiting months for retail Steam Boxes. A year has passed and there has been very little movement of retail availabiulity and I'm still unable to buy a steam controller - nor have I decided to install the SteamOS because so little targets it as a platform - something us onlookers feared would be a death mark for this movement. 

Developers won't target a platofrm that doesn't have suers and users wont use a platform that nobody has developed anything for. 

## The Build

After a year, I'm still running new releases on full settings, such as Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age Origins. Initially I ran BioShock Infinite, Far Cry 3, Witcher 2 etc on full settings. No hiccups. Looked great, ran silently.

You could get all the hardware quite a bit cheaper now thanks to technologies constrnatly degrading value. Also in Australia prices are always higher.

## The Case

Here's the case next to an iPhone 4 for scale.

![fractal case beside iphone][3]


## The Motherboard

![unboxed mother board][4]

Really happy with the board, and the value for money since I last built a serious rig (many years ago!) - the built in WiFi is super effective and very welcomed, i never ended up plugging a hardline in at all.

## Graphics Card

![fans at lower rpm for a quieter heatsink][5]
![gcard is heavy but still slim][6]

## PSU
![corsiar gold psu][7]

Shoter length.

## SSD - Gods gift to man.

![samsung ssd evo840][8]

The performance gains are rediculous.

## Ram

## Building

![empty case][10]

These white trays are Hard Drive bays. Each Hard Drive bay can hold 2 hard drives. Each white plate is a prong, with each drive being mounted on the inside wall og the prong. It comes with rubber grommets for installing traditional disk drives to remove noise from vibration. 

It was mandatory in my case, and i imagine in **all* cases that you have to take the left-most HD bay off to install a Graphics Card. I left only the one bay in to give me some room - and about 6 months later installed that second 500GB SSD into the same right-most bay. 

The case also sports two intake fans hidden behind the front panel, these draw air in through the top section of mesh you can see.

I suggest you install the Hard drives last so you have plenty of room to work.

## Build Stage 1.

![halfway built][11]

This is roughly halfway done. Things to note here is the tight lengthwise fit of the GTX770, it leaves less than an inch of space.

Also, the orientation of the PSU intake / exhaust fan. The intake fan is hidden because it's facing down into the table. The case itself actually sits a few millimetres off the table surface allowing the intake fan to suck air in from below and expell it out the side (you'll later notice the case has ventalation for this purpose).

The GTX770 draws fresh air from another vent along the side.

At this stage you can appreciate just how important the measuring was. This particular corsiar power supply happens to be about 10mm shorter than almost all other PSUs on the market, and I honestly don't think the build would work without it. 

![spacing is tight for the PSU][12]

You can see that because of the orientation of the intake fan, the main power cable has to come straight out **into** the Graphics Card. You don't want to put undue pressure on the cables by forcing a tight angle, so that 10mm makes all the difference. 

Furthermore, the graphics card only just fits lengthwise, but the case intake fan cables require that small amount of space. It can be fiddly to get right, but with some gentle coersion and some cable ties, you can make it work.

This image shows the free space you have to work with in the PSU/GCard corner.

![spacing is tight for the Gcard][13]


## Build Stage 2

Here I've delicately manuvered the Ripjaw's in, and installed the CPU with a stock cooler. 

![cpu and ram added][14]

Then finally you can re-install the harddrive bay.

![rig with bay reinstalled][15]

## Cable Management

You can see that cable management is going to be important given the tight spaces as you install each component. The case doesn't really sport many dedicated cable solutions built-in. I tidied the cables as I went along.

This image shows my method to the cable madness, basically I'm trying to maintain easy airflow from front to back, by keeping the cable spine running along **behind** the graphics card board. This would make even more sense if/when I install a CPU cooler with perpendicular fans. 

![cables neat for airflow][16]

![bundles of cables][17]

The flimsy CPU power cable had me a little worried, so I anchored it to a SSD cable to keep it from fan blades.

![bundles of cables][18]

## Whoops

When I actually went to turn it on i literally had one of those "...wait" moments. To install windows from disk, I had to patch in an old DVD Drive. Then ended up using it for installing all the hardware Drivers anyway. This was always a dedicated SteamBox machine, so everything comes straight from the cloud - which is pretty normal now days. But just be aware, you could never get a disk drive in these things. 

![needed a dvd drive to get started][19]

## Lounge Room : After

Here it is! All finished and sitting in its new home.

## Conclusion

If you have any questions about finished-product performance I'm happy to answer them. 

If you have any questions about the build process itself, I have dozens of photos detailing each step that I have omitted for brevity. 

TomsHardware.com remains an amazing resource for dollar-for-performance benchmarking. Those guys are doing some solid work.
