### Target Audience  

Have a basic familiarity with programming in Java (ideally).  

At best, I'm an *excellent beginner*, and that's all you'll be for reading it. I am by no means a dual weilding code ninja, rather I'm focused on skilling the time poor in some bear neccesities (great song btw). 

## Series Use Case

Perhaps you're a University Graduate well versed in Java, and you've landed a flashy new Ruby job that starts next week - this will help you look like maybe you know what you're talking about.  
Maybe you're a native mobile dev tasked with deploying a simple staging proxy server in Ruby before lunch and you're eating breakfast right now.  

Maybe you're going for a job interview at a shop renouwned for using Ruby - and you want to brush up on a few things, not to pretend that you're already competent at Ruby - but that you quickly 'would be'.  

I've been all of these things, so I feel you. 

You can read a book (too long).
You can trawl the Docs (too specific).
You can watch some videos (yawn). 

Or, you can tear through some of these. 

This is not Gospel, this may even have technical falisies or over-generalisations. It's simply a spring-board to competency. Something to start with.
