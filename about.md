All 3 authors previously worked together in Melbourne, Australia as Mobile Developers for @Outware.

Like most trendy tech startups - the atmosphere was relaxed and dress was casual. Matt had reluctantly forked out for a new suit for a friend's wedding - and Brad was waiting for any opportunity to dress like an adult.

Despite the plentiful 'eye rolls' from many colleagues - the weekly Formal Friday was born. The suits only acted as ignition for celebratory drinks each week - where the local pub became a boozy think-tank of hypothetical technology, rock solid business ventures and totally original epiphanies. 

Then years later we realized we *really* should have written all that stuff down. Sorry.
