I was really lucky to find myself developing in mobile just as iOS was released. The company I was working for at the time went from being a small group of people building games for [this guy](/images/posts/learnmachine/nokia7210.jpg) to being on stage at Apple's WWDC keynote. 

Why was this [little games studio](http://www.firemonkeys.com.au/studio/) of a few guys all of a sudden standing up and showing off their game at WWDC? At least partially it was because we were ahead of everyone else. We knew how to build for constrained devices; the iPhone seemed like it had infinite power compared to the old Nokias. Essentially we had some of the best looking games on the market at the time. Back then you could sell a game on the App Store for $10 a pop! Everyone was trying new things and seeing what happened. It was a cool time. 

But I'm reminiscing. 

I feel like I've achieved a lot as a mobile developer these past few years. But I'm getting the itch to try something new. Relive those old days working on something where no one really knows what they're doing, but still having fun exploring and trying things. 

What's that next Big Thing? 

Of course, it all depends on who you talk to. If you talk to [this guy](http://edge.org/conversation/john_markoff-the-next-wave) he might say that VR is the future. Guys like [Magic Leap](http://www.magicleap.com/) and [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) are paving the way for us to use technology in a whole different way. Just like the iPhone when it was released. 

I have to agree with him, though it probably doesn't help that I'm currently reading [Snow Crash](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830.Snow_Crash). 

We still don't know how far away Magic Leap is from release. So until that day comes I'll have to scratch the "work on the next Big Thing" itch some other way. 

Machine Learning is going to be my next Big Thing. 

With companies like [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/) having huge investment from Google and the number of whitepapers they've released the past few years you get the feeling that this will soon be outside just the realm of academia and the big tech companies. It's going to shape everything we do in our day to day lives. 

I'm starting off by doing what I always do: Reading a good book. 

The book I'm reading is [Machine Learning by Jason Bell](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118889061,subjectCd-ST70.html). 

It's a newly published book (as far as ML and AI publications go) and is aimed at the everyday developer. ie: me. 

As I learn about different systems like Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks I'll post what I can up here. It will reinforce how I understand the topics and hey, maybe I can show you something cool too. :) 

Here's to a new chapter.
