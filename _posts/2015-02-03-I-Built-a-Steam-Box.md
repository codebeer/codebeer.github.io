## Gaming on the Couch 

If you're thinking of moving your PC into the lounge room, my build experience could offer some hints. 

+ Be **very careful** which TV you get to avoid lag or tearing, I wrote a [separate post][tvpost] about it!
+ You will never beat factory built form factors.  
+ In the lounge setting, you may be more conscious of acoustics, get a good case to reduce noise.
+ My build was **millimeter perfect**. If I didn't get this exact PSU, it would NOT FIT.  
+ I had a strict budget to build to when making choices, but have recently added a new 500GB Evo SSD.
+ I was really happy with the final product (PC + TV).

## Comments on Parts (A Year After)

+ **CPU :** The i5-4670K has been replaced by the i5-4690K and is still highly recommended.
+ **Graphics :** The GTX770 was widely accepted as one of the best purchases for 2013. I'm super impressed by my (cheaper) Gigabyte version. I would now look into the 780's etc. I was also conscience of long term running costs, and opted not to SLI two cards. I can't help but feel like the large 4GB on board DDR5 Ram makes the build. The name of the game is localized caching. Put as much as possible on the GPU, then its local RAM, THEN the normal RAM, THEN hopefully rarely the SSD.
+ **RAM :** Even though the Graphics Card has 4GB onboard (which is insane) I would encourage you to future proof and go for the 2x8GB sticks rather than 2x4GB just because the motherboard only supports two sticks.
+ **Motherboard :** I didn't buy this board with the explicit intention to use the on-board WiFi - however I never ended up plugging in a hard line at all! The WiFi reception is awesome and I happily game online with others wirelessly with no lag and the router in another room. Technology man! I can't believe they get so much on a tiny board.

## The TV

I've made an [accompanying post][tvpost] all about the TV tech because it got a bit out of hand! Make sure you read it before you buy anything!

## An Irrelevant Foreword on Agile Development & Community Involvement.

Valve are known for keeping their cards close to their chest with a "It'll be ready when It's ready" attitude which I (as a developer) secretly admire. 

I'm happy waiting for things, despite the flux of hype and rumours. 

When Valve made the decision to open the conversation about their transition into the living room with the Steam Universe community - I thought it was a great move. Get the end user involved in a high risk venture early- and they did, going as far as to send out real beta hardware to user's homes.

As a developer working exclusively in agile environments, I'm all for customer input and frequent small iterations. I believe Valve were instrumental in this area when it came to customer marketplace interfaces - especially with the launch of Steam Greenlight - where potential customers vote on which indie games in their alpha stages should be completed and published to the store. 

If you're interested in this sort of discussion, I recommend you listen to [this early podcast][podcast] from @Outware (are Apps a product or Service?) starring the very bright Lucia, who had recently completed a thesis surrounding the themes of the marketing processes in agile software development.  

## In Retrospect

Anyway, I decided to build a SteamBox myself in January of 2014 and not risk waiting months for retail Steam Boxes. A year has passed and there has been very little movement of retail availability and I'm still unable to buy a steam controller - nor have I decided to install the SteamOS because so little targets it as a platform - something us onlookers feared would be a death mark for this movement. 

Developers won't target a platform that doesn't have users and users won't use a platform that nobody has developed anything for.

## The Build

After a year, I'm still running new releases on full settings, such as Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age Origins. Initially I ran BioShock Infinite, Far Cry 3, Witcher 2 etc on full settings. No hiccups. Looked great, ran silently.

You could get all the hardware quite a bit cheaper now thanks to technologies constantly degrading value. Also in Australia prices are always higher.


## The Lounge Room : Before

![loung room without steambox][1]

## Boxed Parts

![all boxed parts][2]

## The Case

![fractal case beside iphone][3]

Here's the case next to an iPhone 4 for scale. Also note the visible vent on the side, that will be the PSU exhaust.

## The Motherboard

![unboxed mother board][4]

I was really happy with the board. The value for money since I last built a serious rig (many years ago!) is impressive. The built-in WiFi is super effective and very welcomed, i never ended up plugging a hardline in at all.

## Graphics Card

![fans at lower rpm for a quieter heatsink][5]

I opted for the Gigabyte vendor for my graphics card. The Gigabyte version did very well in online reviews, and I have bought Gigabyte in the past. Not buying premium vendor cases can save a lot of money. I was very happy with the tri-fan setup, more fans run at a lower rpm so that most of the time - the unit runs silently. 

It will make an audible whirl/hum generally only at stress on a 30c degree day. 

For the first day or two, it made a worrying clicking noise, and I could visibly see that one of the fans looked as if it wasn't perfectly centered when spinning - but thankfully a few days of use fixed it and it disappeared. 

![gcard is heavy but still slim][6]

The card has some serious heat-sinks going on as well, making it quite heavy - but it remains super slim (another benefit of the Gigabyte build). Buying from another vendor with a thicker casing (even 5mm) would make cable management harder. 

## PSU

![corsiar gold psu][7]

I just want to emphasise again that this Corsair unit is just a tad shorter than most units, and it was super important in order to make it all fit. Also, love yourself - don't skimp on power supplies. Get Gold rated units. You'll thank me. I've had some crappy ones before.

## SSD

![samsung ssd evo840][8]

Here is the Evo840 SSD next to my old HTC One SV, and a CD-Rom for scale. It's practically a credit card.
The performance gains are ridiculous with SSD's coming from traditional disks. Even in the past 12 months they've come down close to 50c a GB. 

## Ram

![ripjaw ram][9]

I forked out for some high(er) quality RAM, but don't go overboard - at a certain point the cost of better timings brings virtually no noticeable benefits. I also made my hardware choices knowing that as the rig ages, I would be tempted to overclock. 

## Building

![empty case][10]

These white trays are Hard Drive bays. Each Hard Drive bay can hold 2 hard drives. Each white plate is a prong, with each drive being mounted on the inside wall of the prong. It comes with rubber grommets for installing traditional disk drives to remove noise from vibration. 

It was mandatory in my situation, that I have to take the leftmost HD bay off to install a Graphics Card. I left only the one bay in to give me some room - and about 6 months later installed that second 500GB SSD into the same rightmost bay. 

The case also sports two intake fans hidden behind the front panel, these draw air in through the top section of mesh you can see.

I suggest you install the Hard drives last so you have plenty of room to work.

---

## Build Stage 1.

![halfway built][11]

This is roughly halfway done. Things to note here is the tight lengthwise fit of the GTX770, it leaves less than an inch of space.

Also, the orientation of the PSU intake / exhaust fan. The intake fan is hidden because it's facing down into the table. The case itself actually sits a few millimetres off the table surface allowing the intake fan to suck air in from below and expel it out the side (you'll later notice the case has ventilation for this purpose).

The GTX770 draws fresh air from another vent along the side.

At this stage you can appreciate just how important the measuring was. This particular Corsair power supply happens to be about 10mm shorter than almost all other PSUs on the market, and I honestly don't think the build would work without it. 

![spacing is tight for the PSU][12]

You can see that because of the orientation of the intake fan, the main power cable has to come straight out **into** the Graphics Card. You don't want to put undue pressure on the cables by forcing a tight angle, so that 10mm makes all the difference. 

Furthermore, the graphics card only just fits lengthwise, but the case intake fan cables require that small amount of space. It can be fiddly to get right, but with some gentle coercion and some cable ties, you can make it work.

This image shows the free space you have to work with in the PSU/GCard corner. (very very little)

![spacing is tight for the Gcard][13]

## Build Stage 2

![cpu and ram added][14]

Here I've delicately maneuvered the Ripjaw's in, and installed the CPU with a stock cooler. This stage is probably the hardest with man hands.

![rig with bay reinstalled][15]

Then finally I re-mounted the hard drive bay.

## Cable Management

![cables neat for airflow][16]

You can see that cable management is going to be important given the tight spaces as you install each component. The case doesn't really sport many dedicated cable solutions built-in. I tidied the cables as I went along.

This image shows my method to the cable madness, basically I'm trying to maintain easy airflow from front to back, by keeping the cable spine running along **behind** the graphics card board. This would make even more sense if/when I install a CPU cooler with perpendicular fans. 

![bundles of cables][17]

![bundles of cables][18]

The flimsy CPU power cable had me a little worried, so I anchored it to a SSD cable to keep it from fan blades.

## Whoops

![needed a dvd drive to get started][19]

When I actually went to turn it on i literally had one of those "...wait" moments. To install windows from disk, I had to patch in an old DVD Drive. Then ended up using it for installing all the hardware Drivers anyway. This was always a dedicated SteamBox machine, so everything comes straight from the cloud - which is pretty normal now days. But just be aware, you could never get a disk drive in these things. 

## Lounge Room : After

![finished rig][20]

Here it is! All finished and sitting in its new home.

## Conclusion

If you have any questions about finished-product performance I'm happy to answer them. 

If you have any questions about the build process itself, I have dozens of photos detailing each step that I have omitted for brevity. 

TomsHardware.com remains an amazing resource for dollar-for-performance benchmarking. Those guys are doing some solid work. 

There is something really satisfying about buying and playing games from the couch for the **fraction** of the costs, look at this tweet in the lead up to my build!
