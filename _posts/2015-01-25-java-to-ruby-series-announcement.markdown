I escaped (again) to the country with a WiFi dongle to learn a new programming language (or 2) for nothing but the joy of satisfying my own curiosity. No deadlines. I'm going to break my own notes & findings into a series of posts to be released gradually.

# Posts in Series 
(This list will be updated as I publish more posts)

+ **[What Are :Symbols?][1]**
+ **[Syntactic Sugars Part 1 - Shorthands & Conventions][2]** 
+ **[Syntactic Sugars Part 2 - Classes & Self][3]**
+ Procs & Lambdas
+ Ducktyping for Carpenters
+ Ruby Tidbits & Tricks
+ Building with Rake
+ & More

## Audience  

Have a basic familiarity with programming in Java (ideally).  

At best, I'm a *confident beginner*, and that's all you'll be for reading it. I am by no means a dual wielding code ninja, rather I'm focused on skilling the time poor in some bear necessities (great song btw). 

## Why?

Perhaps you're a University Graduate well versed in Java, and you've landed a flashy new Ruby job that starts next week - this will help you look like maybe you know what you're talking about.  

Maybe you're a native mobile dev tasked with deploying a simple staging proxy server in Ruby before lunch and you're eating breakfast right now.  

Maybe you're going for a job interview at a shop renowned for using Ruby - and you want to brush up on a few things, not to pretend that you're already competent in Ruby - but that you quickly 'would be'.  

I've been all of these things, so I feel you. 

+ You can read a book (too long).
+ You can trawl the Docs (too specific).
+ You can watch some videos (yawn). 

Or, you can tear through some of these. 

This is not Gospel. It's simply a spring-board to competency. Something to start with.
